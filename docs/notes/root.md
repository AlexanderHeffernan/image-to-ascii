# Welcome to Pixcha

Pixcha is a tool allowing you to convert images into ASCII-art, which can be used in various applications such as terminal emulators, text editors, and more. It supports a wide range of image formats and provides options for customization, including color support and different character sets.

The project is made up of a front-end and a back-end. The front-end is built with Vue.js and TypeScript, and hosted via GitHub Pages. The back-end is built with Rust using [rusty-api](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-api) and hosted on a Raspberry Pi Server.
